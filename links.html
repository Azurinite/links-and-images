    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three types of links:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Absolute links, like to
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' 
            target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.
        </li>
        <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras page</a>.</li>
        <li>Root-relative links, like to the home page of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
    </ul>
